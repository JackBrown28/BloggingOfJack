                    <h2>My favourite games</h2>
                    <p>Since this is a gaming blog, I think one of the first orders of business is for me to list some of my own personal favourites. Over the years that I have been gaming I have played on multiple systems, the earliest I rember being the gameboy advance, starting off with Pokemon Leaf Green. Since then I have played a wide variety of games, spanning different genres and consoles. Read here what are my favourite games and why they're on the list.
                        <br>For this secetion I will be looking at five of my favourtite games of all time. To kick it off number five is...
                        <br>
                    </p>
                    <ol reversed>
                        <li>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</li>
                        <p>Modern warfare 2 was one of those games that I feel I will always look back upon fondly. Many great memories were made playing this game and it was mostly due to the community around it. I remember almost everyone at school (I was in year 8 at the time) talking about this game when we were at school then rushing home to play it. We easily filled up lobbies, often two or more. Many hours were spent on rust to see who was the best. One of my favourite things about the game though was the community made games that we played, my favourite being Mike Myers, a game of infection where Mike Myers could kill with their knife while all other players had to run and hide, leading to some intense games of cat and mouse. No other game has come close yet to how many hours I put into this game and I don’t think any will for a long time.</p>

                        <li>Halo 3</li>
                        <p>Alongside Modern Warfare 2 one of my most played games is Halo 3. This was the first online shooter I played and I ended up playing this for years. One of my favourite features was the community made game modes and maps. Infection was a big hit among me and my friends and it many variations. My personal favourite being the ‘Ghostbusters’, where the zombies are invisible and very fast but cannot kill the uninfected. This leads to a lot of fun messing with the ghostbusters and a very tense hide and seek game. Halo also had as great story mode that me and friends finished together on legendary, something that we were very proud of!</p>

                        <li>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</li>
                        <p>Metal Gear Solid can be a confusing and strange beast for new comers however Once you start following the story closely it is truly fantastic and interesting (however not for everyone!). Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater is technically where the story of Metal Sear Solid begins even though it being the third game in the series. It takes place in the 60s and you play as Naked Snake, who later becomes Big Boss, father of Solid, Liquid and Solidus Snake. It is a simple story that stands on its own quite well, but knowledge of the events of the previous two games will improve the experience. It tells the tale of betrayal and loyalty that puts into the events of almost the entire series into motion. It is a fun game with a great setting that will leave you feeling by the time the credits roll.</p>

                        <li>Pokémon: Leaf Green</li>
                        <p>I’ve talked about Pokémon Leaf Green on this site before but it is truly one of my favourite games. It was one of the earliest games I remember putting in serious hours. I was glued to my Gameboy when I got this game. I was too young to play the original Pokémon games so this was a great place to jump into the franchise. It was very popular at school and the journey to catch them all fuelled many hours on the game. It was simple but had depth to make it fun and worthy of many lost hours. </p>

                        <li>The Binding of Isaac: Antibirth</li>
                        <p>The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth released back in 2014 and has seen multiple DLC and updates. It is my most played game on Steam with over 140 hours put into it. It is very simple to play, controlling like the original Zelda, each floor made up of different rooms. It is a ‘rouge like’, meaning that death is permeant, however it doesn’t take that long to get to the end, around 40 minutes. What makes it interesting is the items that you pick up, normally about 2 per floor, with chances to get more. Repeatedly playing it means you remember what items do what, allowing you to strategize and adapt during your play through.</p>

                    </ol>
                    <p>So there are five of my favourite games, it was very hard trying to decide what games were worthy of being on the list!</p>
