                    <h2>Hands on with the Nintendo Switch</h2>
                    <p class="text1">I recently had the opertunity to play the new Nintendo Switch two weeks before launch. I got some hands on time with Zelda, Mario Kart and Arms. In the article I will be looking at how the console handles, the different modes that it has and wheather I will be buying one come the 3rd of march.
                        <br>On the 10th of feburary I had the chance to attend a free event hosted in Birmingham where I got the chance to play the new Nintendo Switch, Nintendo's new home console that can also act as a portable console.When we arrivied we were greated with a queue and everyone there seemed enthusiastic to get in and play the console. after about twenty miniutes the doors finally opened.The first game that we got to play was ‘Splatoon’, a competitive shooter where the objective is to cover the map with as much of your team’s paint as possible, while eliminating the other team and preventing them from spreading their paint. We got to use the pro controller, which is more like a traditional controller. The game was unique compared to other shooters because you use the motion sensors in the controller to aim. This provided a challenge and unfortunately I didn’t quite perform as expected and ended up near the bottom of the score board.
                        <br><img src="images/controller.jpg" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="controller" width="600px", height="360px"> We next made our way to the Zelda stand, arguably the system’s most anticipated release. Here we got to start from the begging of the game and got to explore some of the game’s open world. What was interesting was that we could get to use the console’s portable mode and this was very impressive. The transition was seamless and I have never seen a game run so well on a tablet. There was almost no delay between the transitions, after seeing this game I saw the potential as a portable console too.
                        <br> After the Breath of The Wild we got a chance to play 1, 2, Switch, a collection of mini games. The first game we played was a cowboy style showdown where you must draw your controller and fire before your opponents. I felt that this was a very entertaining party game but not something that I could see myself coming back too. Similarly, the second game was a race to milk a cow as fast of possible. While this game wasn’t as fun to play as the quickdraw it was entertaining and almost impossible to keep a straight face while playing!
                        <br> We then moved onto Snipperclips, a co-operative puzzle game where you must cut shapes out of each other to complete tasks. This was played exclusively on the Switch’s tablet and each player used a JoyCon controller to control their character. I felt the game was very entertaining and liked the fact that it had to be played on one screen to make you work together. I think that this could be a good game to have for the console since it could be played anywhere and is very accessible. I am a big fan of co-opertive games and this was right up my street. I imagine it could get frustrating but not becuase iof bad design, just when your partner won't do what you tell them!
                        <br> <img src="images/tablet.jpg" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Mario Kart Tablet" width="600px", height="360px"> After finishing a quick round on Snipperclips we got a chance to play Mario Kart on the tablet, not much to say here, Mario Kart is always fun and it looked great on the tablet. The final game we played was Arms, a fighting game where you use the detached JoyCon controllers to swing and fight the other player. It was reminiscent of the original Wii sports boxing but had a lot more depth and character. It uses characters that have special abilities, making each fighter unique. The motion controls were a lot more accurate to, allowing you to flick your wrist to swing and attack from the sides. This is a game that I enjoyed a lot, not just becuase I won every round! It has the potenial for a wide veriety of abilites and playstyles. The only negavtive thing about it was that I felt that it was to easy to spam 'Ultimate attacks' which are attacks that deal a lot of damage and can't be escaped once you've been caught in them. <img src="images/arms.jpg" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Arms" width="500px", height="660px"> Over the event I got to experience the different set ups that the console offers. I very much enjoyed my time with the console and getting to use it hands on opened my mind to it, where before I tended to avoid Nintendo consoles. Right now I have two worries about the console; the library and the power of the console. I do feel optimistic about it expanding I can't but think back to the Wii U which after a year of it's release there was hardly any third party support. Nintendo seem to have pushed the support at it's reveal so hopefully there will be more support but only time will tell. Secondly the power of the console. It roughly works out to be a bit more powerful than an Xbox 360 but no where near the Xbox One. This is worrying considering that Sony and Microsoft have had to revise thier current gen offerings to be more powerful. This comes back to the thrid party games, why would I choose to purchase a infirior version on the switch? Nintendo have never been ones to puch games to graphical limits of the time, prefering to offer unique and fun gameplay instead. I feel that this will be a more casual console in comparison to the Xbox or PS4. I don’t think that I will be purchasing one on release but it is on my radar now and perhaps in a year when the library is larger I could see myself picking one up!</p>

                    <h2>The Best Music in Gaming</h2>
                    <p>Music is a key component in building atmosphere in games. Over the years music in video games has gone from simple melodies to using full orchestras and technology to sync up with player actions. I will be devling into what games influenced music in gaming the most and the newest technologies pushing forward the industry.
                        <br> Recently I have been thinking a lot about how important music is to a game. In almost every situation music is crucial to the atmosphere, whether it be loud and energetic or sombre for more quiet moments. I’m going to be looking at some of my favourite tracks from games and why music is important.
                        <br> One of the first games I remember playing for a long amount of time was Pokémon Leaf Green and throughout all my years of gaming I will never forget the Route 1 music that starts off your adventure into the world of Pokémon. It’s simplistic, probably due to hardware limitations, however it just inspires this sense of adventure that makes you want to explore the world. It reflects your position in the game then, it’s not an almighty orchestra it’s just a simple tune, just as you are simply starting your adventure with your new Pokémon. This is the first time in the game that your left to your own devices and it’s a very adventurous tune that pushes you to continue onwards into the larger world. It also helps that it is very catchy and easy to hum along too, especially for a five-year-old. On the other end of the spectrum is the DOOM 2016 sound track. It is a full orchestra that uses very intense, high tempo for when you are battling the hordes of hell. It truly manages to make you feel like this force of nature and it makes you almost find a rhythm to the madness, feeling like you sync up your actions to the music. An intense guitar riff? Better get out the chainsaw! You can tell that a lot of thought went into this soundtrack and it just fits perfectly. On quieter moments, the music is almost silent, giving a mysterious character to the Mars base and leaving you wanting to hear the next chaotic battle.

                        <br> Music can also be used to set the tone of a game. One game that I like to relate this too is Sonic Adventure 2. While admittedly it is not the greatest of games it was one of my favourite games from my childhood. The first level opens with a very cheesy pop song that stinks of the early two thousands but for that reason I love it. The level is sunny and Sonic has a skateboard made of a helicopter part, what more could you want when you’re six? A cheesy pop song to accompany it of course! It helped to set the stage for the game and what type of game it is, next gen Sonic, bigger and better. Music is a scene setter and sometimes a factor that we don’t appreciate when it’s there but it would be apparent if it was absent. It can tell a lot about a game when it has a sound track that helps to back up what is happening on the screen.

                    <h2>My favourite games</h2>
                    <p>Since this is a gaming blog, I think one of the first orders of business is for me to list some of my own personal favourites. Over the years that I have been gaming I have played on multiple systems, the earliest I rember being the gameboy advance, starting off with Pokemon Leaf Green. Since then I have played a wide variety of games, spanning different genres and consoles. Read here what are my favourite games and why they're on the list.
                        <br>For this secetion I will be looking at five of my favourtite games of all time. To kick it off number five is...
                        <br>
                    </p>
                    <ol reversed>
                        <li>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</li>
                        <p>Modern warfare 2 was one of those games that I feel I will always look back upon fondly. Many great memories were made playing this game and it was mostly due to the community around it. I remember almost everyone at school (I was in year 8 at the time) talking about this game when we were at school then rushing home to play it. We easily filled up lobbies, often two or more. Many hours were spent on rust to see who was the best. One of my favourite things about the game though was the community made games that we played, my favourite being Mike Myers, a game of infection where Mike Myers could kill with their knife while all other players had to run and hide, leading to some intense games of cat and mouse. No other game has come close yet to how many hours I put into this game and I don’t think any will for a long time.</p>
                        <img src="http://assets2.ignimgs.com/2010/03/25/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-20100325073923773-3169490.jpg" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Modern Warfare 2" width="600px", height="360px">
                        <li>Halo 3</li>
                        <p>Alongside Modern Warfare 2 one of my most played games is Halo 3. This was the first online shooter I played and I ended up playing this for years. One of my favourite features was the community made game modes and maps. Infection was a big hit among me and my friends and it many variations. My personal favourite being the ‘Ghostbusters’, where the zombies are invisible and very fast but cannot kill the uninfected. This leads to a lot of fun messing with the ghostbusters and a very tense hide and seek game. Halo also had as great story mode that me and friends finished together on legendary, something that we were very proud of!</p>
                        <img src="http://halo.bungie.net/images/games/Halo3/Screenshots/Halo3_MP_Isolation_1st-01.jpg" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Halo 3" width="600px", height="360px">
                        <li>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</li>
                        <p>Metal Gear Solid can be a confusing and strange beast for new comers however Once you start following the story closely it is truly fantastic and interesting (however not for everyone!). Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater is technically where the story of Metal Sear Solid begins even though it being the third game in the series. It takes place in the 60s and you play as Naked Snake, who later becomes Big Boss, father of Solid, Liquid and Solidus Snake. It is a simple story that stands on its own quite well, but knowledge of the events of the previous two games will improve the experience. It tells the tale of betrayal and loyalty that puts into the events of almost the entire series into motion. It is a fun game with a great setting that will leave you feeling by the time the credits roll.</p>
                        <img src="https://r.mprd.se/fup/up/153808-Metal_Gear_Solid_3_-_Snake_Eater_(Spain)-1.jpg" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Metal Gear Solid 3" width="600px", height="360px">
                        <li>Pokémon: Leaf Green</li>
                        <p>I’ve talked about Pokémon Leaf Green on this site before but it is truly one of my favourite games. It was one of the earliest games I remember putting in serious hours. I was glued to my Gameboy when I got this game. I was too young to play the original Pokémon games so this was a great place to jump into the franchise. It was very popular at school and the journey to catch them all fuelled many hours on the game. It was simple but had depth to make it fun and worthy of many lost hours. </p>
                        <img src="https://r.mprd.se/media/images/44875-Pokemon_Leaf_Green_(U)(Independent)-17.png" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Pokemon" width="600px", height="360px">
                        <li>The Binding of Isaac: Antibirth</li>
                        <p>The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth released back in 2014 and has seen multiple DLC and updates. It is my most played game on Steam with over 140 hours put into it. It is very simple to play, controlling like the original Zelda, each floor made up of different rooms. It is a ‘rouge like’, meaning that death is permeant, however it doesn’t take that long to get to the end, around 40 minutes. What makes it interesting is the items that you pick up, normally about 2 per floor, with chances to get more. Repeatedly playing it means you remember what items do what, allowing you to strategize and adapt during your play through.</p>
                        <img src="https://media.playstation.com/is/image/SCEA/the-binding-of-isaac-rebirth-screenshot-01-ps4-psvita-us-15oct14?$MediaCarousel_Original$" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Binding of Isaac" width="600px", height="360px">
                    </ol>
                    <p>So there are five of my favourite games, it was very hard trying to decide what games were worthy of being on the list!</p>
