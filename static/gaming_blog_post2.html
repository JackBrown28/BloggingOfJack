                    <h2>The Best Music in Gaming</h2>
                    <p>Music is a key component in building atmosphere in games. Over the years music in video games has gone from simple melodies to using full orchestras and technology to sync up with player actions. I will be devling into what games influenced music in gaming the most and the newest technologies pushing forward the industry.
                        <br> Recently I have been thinking a lot about how important music is to a game. In almost every situation music is crucial to the atmosphere, whether it be loud and energetic or sombre for more quiet moments. I’m going to be looking at some of my favourite tracks from games and why music is important.
                        <br> One of the first games I remember playing for a long amount of time was Pokémon Leaf Green and throughout all my years of gaming I will never forget the Route 1 music that starts off your adventure into the world of Pokémon. It’s simplistic, probably due to hardware limitations, however it just inspires this sense of adventure that makes you want to explore the world. It reflects your position in the game then, it’s not an almighty orchestra it’s just a simple tune, just as you are simply starting your adventure with your new Pokémon. This is the first time in the game that your left to your own devices and it’s a very adventurous tune that pushes you to continue onwards into the larger world. It also helps that it is very catchy and easy to hum along too, especially for a five-year-old. On the other end of the spectrum is the DOOM 2016 sound track. It is a full orchestra that uses very intense, high tempo for when you are battling the hordes of hell. It truly manages to make you feel like this force of nature and it makes you almost find a rhythm to the madness, feeling like you sync up your actions to the music. An intense guitar riff? Better get out the chainsaw! You can tell that a lot of thought went into this soundtrack and it just fits perfectly. On quieter moments, the music is almost silent, giving a mysterious character to the Mars base and leaving you wanting to hear the next chaotic battle.

                        <br> Music can also be used to set the tone of a game. One game that I like to relate this too is Sonic Adventure 2. While admittedly it is not the greatest of games it was one of my favourite games from my childhood. The first level opens with a very cheesy pop song that stinks of the early two thousands but for that reason I love it. The level is sunny and Sonic has a skateboard made of a helicopter part, what more could you want when you’re six? A cheesy pop song to accompany it of course! It helped to set the stage for the game and what type of game it is, next gen Sonic, bigger and better. Music is a scene setter and sometimes a factor that we don’t appreciate when it’s there but it would be apparent if it was absent. It can tell a lot about a game when it has a sound track that helps to back up what is happening on the screen.
