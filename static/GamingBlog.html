Over the years music in video games has gone from simple melodies to using full orchestras and technology to sync up with player actions. I will be delving into what games influenced music in gaming the most and the newest technologies pushing forward the industry.</p>

                <p class="info">Since this is a gaming blog, I think one of the first orders of business is for me to list some of my own personal favourites. Over the years that I have been gaming I have played on multiple systems, the earliest I remember being the Gameboy Advance, starting off with Pokemon Leaf Green. Since then I have played a wide variety of games, spanning different genres and consoles. Read here what my favourite games are and why they're on the list.</p>
